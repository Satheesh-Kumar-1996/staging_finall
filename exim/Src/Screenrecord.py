#Summary For the above File
'''
This function captures your screen continuously in a loop, writes the screenshots as frames to a video file, and stops cleanly when told to via 
the stop_event. It handles color conversion and video encoding using OpenCV and uses a thread-safe event to signal stopping the recording.
